This directory contains the code for seq2seq with attention-based copying from
the input sequence.

Requirements:
- tensorflow==1.3.0 OR tensorflow-gpu==1.3.0
- nltk==3.2.5 and punkt tokenizer models
- numpy==1.13.1
- PyYAML==3.11
- scikit-learn==0.18.2
- scipy==0.19.0
- sqlparse==0.2.4


To run an example, starting from this directory:
```
export S2S_HOME=$(pwd)
./prep_advising.sh
python2 config_builder.py experimental_configs/example_config.yml
cd models/copy_input/advising_query_split/
./experiment.sh
```

Console output for the prep_advising script should look like the contents of `sample_output/expected_prep_script_output.txt`.
Console output for the config_builder should look like `sample_output/expected_config_builder_output.txt`.

The experiment will take several hours to run. Its output will be in `models/copy_input/advising_query_split/quick_eval.txt` (dev set) and `models/copy_input/advising_query_split/quick_eval_train.txt` (train set).
Examples of these output files are in `sample_output/`.

To run your own experiments, modify the `prep_advising.sh` to refer to the dataset
of your choice, and adjust the hyperparameters the config YAML file.
Note that the hyperparameters in example_config.yml are an example only;
actual hyperparameters used in the paper will follow in a later update.
